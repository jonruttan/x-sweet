# x-sweet -- the Sweet lang for x-lang
#
# INSTALL PUTS THIS BUNDLE WHERE `-l` LOOKS, which is the whole of it: an
# installed x searches <share>/langs/*/lang.xon, so a lang is "installed" when
# its files are there.  No registry, no database, no per-project pin.
#
#   make install                  into the x on PATH
#   PREFIX=$HOME/.local make install    into a particular prefix
#
# PIN OR INSTALL, AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.  A pin (lang.pin.xon +
# Pin bundle) freezes a verified tarball for ONE project and is what a build
# should depend on.  An install puts one copy on the machine for every project
# and for the prompt -- convenient, unversioned, and exactly like installing a
# language runtime.  Use the pin when it matters which version; use this when
# you just want `x -l sweet` to work.

X ?= x

# THE VERSION IS DERIVED, NEVER COMMITTED, and that is deliberate.
#
# A version row in lang.xon can only be true at ONE commit: the one you tag.
# Bump it and tag it and the tree is honest for exactly that moment; every
# commit after claims a release it is not, and a checkout of main always lies.
# git describe does not -- v0.2.0-3-gabc123-dirty says precisely where you are.
#
# So lang.xon declares what this lang REQUIRES, and the installed artifact
# carries what it IS.  Same split, and the same mechanism, as x-lang's own
# $(X_RELEASE) -> <lib>/contract/release.
LANG_VERSION ?= $(shell git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo dev)
# PREFIX wins when given, so this matches x-lang's own `PREFIX=... make
# install`.  Otherwise ask the x on PATH where its tree is -- the question
# --share-dir exists to answer.
SHARE := $(if $(PREFIX),$(PREFIX)/share/x,$(shell $(X) --share-dir))
DEST  := $(SHARE)/langs/sweet

# What a consumer needs to RUN the lang: the declaration, the entry, the
# modules.  Not the suite, not the tooling, not CI -- those are this
# repository's business, not the installed platform's.
