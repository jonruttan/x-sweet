# NOT ONE PATH INTO THE X-LANG SOURCE TREE.  The 2024 runner reached the
# platform as "$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../tests/spec-runner.sh" and both that and
# its X_BIN dangled the moment the personality left the repo -- the failure
# x-lang docs/personality-contract.md calls "addressing, not sharing".
# Everything here comes from x itself: --share-dir says which tree x reads
# from (repo root in a checkout, share/x installed) and --engine-path says
# where the engine is after the wrapper's full discovery order.
#
# Set X to point at a particular x; otherwise the one on PATH is used.

# --share-dir answers from ANY cwd as of x-lang 990c4a35.  It did not at first:
# mode detection is cwd-based, so a checkout's x.sh asked from outside took the
# installed branch and computed a share/x no checkout has.  This runner used to
# cd to the wrapper's own directory before asking -- the guessing the flag
# exists to end.  Reported, fixed upstream, dance removed.

# REQUIRED FROM AN INSTALLED TREE.  The runner finds its awk harness from the
# directory holding the ENGINE -- true in a checkout, where the binary sits
# beside tests/, and false in an install, where the engine is under libexec/x.
