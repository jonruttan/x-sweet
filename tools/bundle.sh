#
# @description Builds x-sweet-<tag>.tar.gz from a clean tree and prints the
#   (bundle ...) row a consumer's lang.pin.xon must carry.

# Usage: sh tools/bundle.sh [TAG] [OUTDIR]
#
# FROM GIT, NOT FROM THE WORKING TREE.  `git archive` ships exactly what is
# committed at the tag: no .git, no generated harness, no editor droppings, and
# nothing a dirty checkout happened to be carrying.  A tarball whose contents
# depend on whose machine rolled it is a tarball whose digest means nothing.
#
# DETERMINISTIC, so two people rolling the same tag get the same bytes and so
# the same digest.  git archive sorts its entries and stamps every file with
# the COMMIT's time rather than the clock; gzip is told -n so it does not
# record a timestamp of its own.  Without that last flag the digest changes
# every run and the pin becomes unverifiable by anyone but the roller.

# The prefix is a plain directory name so the archive unpacks into one place;
# Pin bundle unpacks into a staging directory it owns, so the prefix is for a
# human untarring it by hand, not for the tool.
# THE STAMP IS THE ONE THING THE COMMIT CANNOT CARRY.  Everything else in
# this archive is exactly what was committed, deliberately -- but a version
# row in lang.xon could only be true at the single commit that gets tagged,
# and would be a lie in the tree both before and after it.  So the tag says
# what this is, and the archive carries that as a file the checkout has not
# got, matching what `make install` writes from git describe.
#
# git archive --add-file (2.38+) keeps the determinism: entries are sorted
# and stamped with the COMMIT's time, added ones included.  The one thing it
# takes from the local file is its MODE, so that is pinned -- otherwise two
# rollers with different umasks produce different bytes, which is precisely
# the failure the -n on gzip below exists to prevent.
